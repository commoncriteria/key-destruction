# key-destruction

This whitepaper contains a set Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for key destruction that an international Technical Community (iTC) should use when writing a cPP. There is a corresponding set of Evaluation Activities (EAs) that should be used when drafting the Supporting Document (SD). This set of requirements is intended to include all possible use cases ranging from a TOE that is composed of software and hardware and where the developer has a complete understanding of how memory is managed in their product, to a software application where the developer has no idea what memory media the underlying hardware platform is using.
